so im trying to implement a wireless communication method for my esp laser tag game. the game will be run with mqtt. i want each esp device to either connect to wifi directly and talk to the mqtt server, or connect through a esp mesh with a root node connected to the laptop the mqtt server is running on. im trying to use as much existing code in the xas / lzrtag implementation as possible. it's already got a mqtt handler, but thats for wifi directly. so im making this communicationmanager component which abstracts the handler bit and that way the wifi mqtt handler can inherit it and then also the esp mesh method can inherit it too. and then at the end of the day, the laser tag code can switch between the two methods at will.
