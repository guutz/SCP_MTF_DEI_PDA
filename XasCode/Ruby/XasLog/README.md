# XasLogger - a colorized, multi-output mixing

Really, this is just a fancy wrapper for the standard Ruby logger. I didn't like
how it looks, I prefer the colorized output of the ESP-IDF's logger - can you blame me?

Either way, this simple and smol gem provides a few helper functions and mix-ins
to allow for multi-output logging, per-module log level setting, colorized output
and a mix-in for extra easy logging of class based code :>
